# What is in each folder
Each folder corresponds to a separate assignment. Find in each folder the problem statment, the data files, the R Markdown file containing the R code and comments as well as the corresponding knitted HTML file.
1. Density estimation, GMM and DBSCAN: Estimation of densities using kernel estimator. Gaussian Mixture models for clustering, cluster merging. DBSCAN algorithm for clustering. Libraries used: sm, mclust
2. Non-linear dimensionality reduction: Principal curves, Local MDS, ISOMAP, SNE, t-SNE, comparison of methods. 
3. Local linear regression and local Poisson regression
4. Non-parametric regression: Cubic regression splines, non-parametric logistic regession.
5. Generalized Additive Models: Fitting several GAM models, including semiparametric. Visualization and model selection.
6. Functional data analysis and its descriptive tools: Transforming a matrix into FDA, functional mean, median, correlation and standard deviation. Median and the trimmed mean based on Fraiman and Muniz depth. Outlier detection.
7. Functional PCA and MDS.
8.  Interpretability and Explainability in Machine Learning: Variable importance (impurity, OOB and Shapley Values). Ghost variables.  Global importance: Partial Dependence Plots, Local
Dependence Plots, Accumulated Local Effects. Local explainers: SHAP, Break-down, LIME, ICE.
